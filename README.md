# Housing Sales Price Trend Analysis

Summary
---
Perform exploratory data analysis and build visual from data set containing average and median home sales for the U.S from 1964-2024.

Process
---
After downloading datasets from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis I used the Pandas library to manipulate and clean them. 

Ultimately merging both average and median datasets into one and then renaming attributes for clearer context and then exporting into a ready to use .CSV file. 

Lastly, I used Tableau to visualize the price trends as well as show a constant line for reference.


Highlights
---
* The average sales price for homes increasingly outpaces the median, indicating that more expensive homes are appreciating faster.
* The latest median income for an individual was reported by Sofi as approximately $60,000 a year. Someone with that income can afford a house at a price of about $230,000. 
* The last time the median house cost less than $250,000 was 2012.
